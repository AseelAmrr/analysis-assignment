 we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. If and only if a graph is connected (i.e., there is a path connecting each pair of nodes) and free of cycles, then it is a tree.

The running time for detecting whether an undirected graph is a tree using DFS or BFS is O(V + E),
